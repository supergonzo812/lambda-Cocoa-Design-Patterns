# lambda-Cocoa-Design-Patterns

Each of you choose a design pattern and think of an instance you’ve used it in code you’ve written or have seen it used in UIKit.
Look through the documentation and find at least one UIKit class that uses the singleton pattern.
Think about a time we’ve used the facade pattern before. Are there places that we could have used it to write better code but didn’t? Discuss with your partner.
Write code to post a notification when a button is tapped indicating a bell has rung. In another class, sign up to be notified when this notification is posted, and make sure it works.
Add support for state restoration to another app you’ve built.
